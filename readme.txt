Hello! Thank you so much for downloading my game. :3

To play the game,
1. Download: Desquarium-win.zip if on Windows
             Desquarium-mac.zip if on MacOS
2. Extract the file, and it's ready to play!

PS. MacOS users might get a pop up saying that Apple could not verify the application -- when that happens,
go to Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down to find the warning under Security and click on "Allow Anyway"

This game is just a simple aquarium game where you can feed the fishes, and 
clean the aquarium when it gets dirty. When you click "new game", it opens a screen where
you click on the "pull" button randomly to get 6 random fishes out of 12 fishes. Clicking the
"aquarium" button directs you to your aquarium. When you feed the fish, they go and eat the food.
The aquarium gradually gets covered with the algae, and you have to clean it clicking the
"clean algae" button.

When you come back to the application again later, simply click "load game" and
it will load your aquarium with all your old fishes.

I created this game using the Godot engine, the "game files" folder has all the files for it.
If you want to look at the code, download the folder and click on the file called "project.godot". 
Make sure you have Godot installed.

All the art and VFX in this game were hand drawn by me, using my iPad. Some of
the fishes in the game were fishes I had in my childhood aquarium. It was really fun to
draw them all!

The audio I have used is called aquatic ambience by @scizzie on SoundCloud,
please show the creator some love for this amazing track:
